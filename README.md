### 1.2 Barcode Generating Function

Barcode generating function is for generating the label of single sample. Information for one sample is limited, we are able to generate label with the same information as the initial status without doing anyother treatment.

</br>

There's a problem we need to be aware of. Barcode have various of different type, each type of barcode have its [unique format requirment](https://www.premierelectronics.com/blog/barcode-types-identificaton-understanding)(Click hyperlink to see more information). The most commonly used format is 'EAN13'. However, it's only compatible with numbers. In our project, we need our system to be compatible with both letters and numbers and we found Code39 worked. Once we applied Code39 as our barcode format, another issue occured. 'qrcode' library can only create a SVG format file. We might need to convert SVG format into PNG format.

The figure below, is an example of the generation of barcode.

### 1.3 QRcode Generating Function

QRcode generating function is typically for label generation of a serie of samples. Normally, a series of information consist large amount of repeated information. If we transfer all the information into a QRcode, the graph will be in a messy. Thus, a compress algorithm is applied before

## 2. Dashboard for upstream process

The dashboard system is based on a library called 'Dash'[??]. Two functions are embedded in the dashboard system.
|Page|Usage|
|-|-|
|Time series line chart|Empty samples are dropped automatically. Is able to conduct comparison between both different samples as well as different process conditions|
|Correlation coefficient heat map|Illustrate the correlation coefficient heat map between each two parameters.|


## 3. Classifer

If a new sample is sent to the laboratory. Researchers need to do a DOE research to find out the best condition for cells to produce the most product we want (Highest Titer). This process is always costly and time-consuming. Thus, we developed a Big Data Management tool to help researchers to look up the history experiments. Through comparing the data, they might be able to find out some old samples which have close behaviours. In this case, they can use the old samples' parameters as a reference and this can reduce the the number of experiments.

Two kinds of classifer are developed in this capstone project. The first one is based on PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and Logistics Regression, the second one is based on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).

### First Approach (PCA & Logistic Regression)

PCA is a method to process dimensional reduction and try to maintain as much information as possible. This can reduce the number of calculation later on.

Logistic Regression is one of the most popular method to build a classifier. It can be seen as to concatenate a linear regression with a sigmoid function. The output can show the probability of which class it belongs to.

The path of the code is Capstone/Classifier/pca&lr.py

### Second Approach (CNN)

One lethal drawback for the Logistic Regression is it can only conduct comparison for specific time node. However, the data generated from upstream process is continuous. 

Thus, we want to make comparison among those time series line charts generated by our dash board system. The main idea for us to apply convolutional neural network is we want the computer to act like a researcher, and find characteristics for each individual class by itself.
